  summary: 'Compares the Sequence Number of a property with the SequenceNumber

    argument.

    A property''s sequence number can be thought of as that property''s version.

    Every time the property is modified, its sequence number is increased.

    The sequence number can be found in a property''s metadata.

    The comparison fails if the sequence numbers are not equal.

    CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation is generally used as a precondition for

    the write operations in the batch.

    Note that if one PropertyBatchOperation in a PropertyBatch fails,

    the entire batch fails and cannot be committed in a transactional manner.


    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.
