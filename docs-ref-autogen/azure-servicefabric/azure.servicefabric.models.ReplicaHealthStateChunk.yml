    The replica health state contains the replica ID and its aggregated health

        both stateful and stateless services. It is used by Service Fabric to

        uniquely identify a replica of a partition of a stateful service or an

        instance of a stateless service partition. It is unique within a partition

        and does not change for the lifetime of the replica or the instance. If a

        stateful replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same

        node for the same partition, it will get a different value for the ID. If

        a stateless instance is failed over on the same or different node it will

        get a different value for the ID.
